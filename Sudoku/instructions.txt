INTRODUCTION:

This is a copy of the game sudoku written in Python 3.9. The game is playable by itself, and also uses a backtracking algorithm to solve
grid states for you as well. There are multiple boards located in the sudokuGrids file. More can be added or subtracted as wanted.

CONTROLS:

To play, simply click a square and type a number from 1-9. A selected square will be highlighted red.

The arrow keys can be used to move which selected cell you have.

The 'G' key changes the grid currently seen. The 'S' key solves the grid using the backtracking algoritm. The 'C' key checks if the current
grid is solved or not. The 'E' key empties the hovered cell.

NOTES:

Invalid values cannot be typed, as the backtracking algorithm cannot solve the board given wrong values.

The solve key is intented for solving a fresh board, and will not solve a worked on board, unless the work is correct! Otherwise the
backtracking algorithm will simply say the board is unsolvable.
